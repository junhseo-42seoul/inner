Once we have the file open,
we read its contents by calling the read() function and passing the “fd” descriptor that is returned by the open() function as the first argument.
We pass the pointer to the “buff” buffer as the second argument where we store the contents to be read.
Finally, we pass the size of the buffer which is 1024 bytes in this case.
We then use the printf() function to display the contents that are stored in “buff” in the command console.
